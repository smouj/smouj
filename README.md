## Philosophy
- **Local-first** by design
- **Total privacy** whenever possible
- **Open models** over lock-in
- **No mandatory paid APIs**

Each skill is modular and can run standalone or as part of a coordinated superagent architecture.

## How to collaborate
1. Pick one skill from the universe
2. Open an issue with your idea or bug report
3. Submit a PR with clear scope and validation notes

Wild ideas are welcome. Stars and forks are deeply appreciated.
